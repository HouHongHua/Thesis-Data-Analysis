# **Thesis Data Analysis**

This repository contains the data analysis and methodologies developed for my master's thesis. Due to confidentiality requirements for journal submissions, specific details regarding the statistical distributions and the finite mixture multivariate censored distribution algorithm cannot be fully disclosed at this time.

## **The Slash Distribution**

The **slash distribution** (William H. Rogers and John Tukey, 1972) is a probability distribution derived from the ratio of a standard normal variable to an independent uniform variable. Its primary strength lies in its **heavy tails** and **kurtosis**, which make it an excellent tool for modeling data with outliers or extreme valuesâ€”a common challenge for normal distributions. It is widely used in statistical simulation and robust statistical inference.

To handle missing or censored values, the slash distribution lacks a closed-form solution. We addressed this challenge by incorporating the **Monte Carlo Expectation Conditional Maximization Either (MCECME) algorithm** along with **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods**. Specifically, we used the **Metropolis-Hastings algorithm** to approximate the target distribution from complex probabilities.

A comparative analysis was performed between the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the **General Parallel Metropolis-Hastings (GPMH) algorithm** (Ben Calderhead, 2014) to evaluate approximation quality and computational efficiency. The GPMH algorithm, with its parallel sampling design, demonstrated significantly faster convergence compared to the original, single-sampling approach.

## **Case Studies & Applications**

### **Case 1: Geochemistry in Norway**

* **Dataset:** Geochemistry of B-horizon/1, from PANGAEA (Reimann, Clemens, 1998).
* **Context:** This project, one of the largest environmental geochemistry studies ever conducted, explores various elements across different media within a 188,000 square kilometer area of Norway, covering both polluted and pristine zones.
* **Analysis:** The dataset contains diverse elements and compounds, each with unique detection limits. Given the range of information and distinct characteristics of each sample, a **multivariate regression model** was selected for a comprehensive analysis.

### **Case 2: Dissolved Mercury in the California Current System**

* **Dataset:** Dissolved Mercury Speciation in the California Current System, from a collaborative project hosted by the California Center for Long-term Ecosystem Research.
* **Context:** This dataset includes samples of dissolved mercury (Hg) speciation collected during a 2021 cruise. It documents four types of mercury, each with different detection limits and units (femtomolar and picomolar), alongside environmental factors such as depth, temperature, and salinity, which affect mercury solubility.
* **Analysis:** An algorithm analysis revealed that a **multigroup multivariate regression model** provided superior results for this complex dataset.

## **Model & Results**

After data cleaning, we opted for a **heavy-tailed model** for our analysis, directly incorporating the detection limits into the multivariate data. A comparison of our heavy-tailed regression model against a standard normal regression model is visualized in the charts below.

In the histograms (including density lines), our model (represented by the **red line**) shows a better fit to the observed values. Similarly, in the contour plots, the **red line** representing our model demonstrates a more accurate fitting of the data, outperforming other models.
