After data cleaning, we chose to use the fat-tailed model for analysis, and detection limits were included in the multivariate data. 
The visual chart can compare the fat-tailed regression model and the normal regression model.
經過資料清洗過後，選擇使用厚尾模型進行分析，多變量數據中包含檢測限制。可視化圖表中可以厚尾迴歸模型與常態迴歸模型的比較。

Case 1. Quoted from the data set recorded on the PANGAEA website, studied and recorded by Clemens et al. (1998), the exploration of all elements in different media within a 188,000 square kilometer research area in Norway. 
        The project covers polluted areas in Northern Europe and Pristine Zone is one of the largest environmental geochemistry studies ever undertaken.

        The data set contains a variety of elements or compounds, whose individual detection limits are recorded later and are all different, as well as a variety of information about the sample taken. 
        Therefore, a multivariable regression model was selected for analysis.

Case 2. The data comes from the collaborative project "Untangling the Marine Dimethylmercury Cycle" hosted by the California Center for Long-term Ecosystem Research in Current Ecosystems. 
        Dissolved mercury (Hg) speciation samples collected during a 2021 cruise to the California Current System.

        This data contains a total of 4 mercury types, each of which has different detection limits and units (femtomolar & picomolar).
        The data set also documents the multiple factors involved in mercury dissolution in the ocean, including: depth, temperature, and salinity.
        Different factors will affect the degree of solubility of mercury compounds.
        In the algorithm analysis, it can be seen that the multi-group multivariable regression model has better analysis results.
