After data cleaning, we chose to use the fat-tailed model for analysis, and detection limits were included in the multivariate data. 
The comparison between the fat-tail regression model and the normal regression model can be seen in the visual chart.
經過資料清洗過後，選擇使用厚尾模型進行分析，多變量數據中包含檢測限制。可視化圖表中可以看到肥尾迴歸模型和常態迴歸模型的比較。

Case 1. 
Based on the dataset recorded on the PANGAEA website and studied by Clemens et al. (1998), an exploration was conducted of all elements in different media within a 188,000 square kilometer research area in Norway. 
This project, which covers polluted areas in Northern Europe and the Pristine Zone, is one of the largest environmental geochemistry studies ever undertaken.
來自於 PANGEA 網站上記錄並由 Clemens(1998) 等人蒐集的資料集，在挪威 188,000 平方公里的區域內對不同介質中的所有元素進行了探勘。
計畫涵蓋北歐與其原始區的污染地區，是有史以來最大的環境地球化學研究之一。
The dataset contains a variety of elements and compounds, each with different individual detection limits, as well as a range of information about the samples taken. 
Therefore, a multivariable regression model was selected for analysis.

Case 2. 
The data comes from the collaborative project "Untangling the Marine Dimethylmercury Cycle" hosted by the California Center for Long-term Ecosystem Research in Current Ecosystems. 
Dissolved mercury (Hg) speciation samples collected during a 2021 cruise to the California Current System.

This data contains a total of 4 mercury types, each of which has different detection limits and units (femtomolar & picomolar).
The data set also documents the multiple factors involved in mercury dissolution in the ocean, including: depth, temperature, and salinity.
Different factors will affect the degree of solubility of mercury compounds.
In the algorithm analysis, it can be seen that the multi-group multivariable regression model has better analysis results.
